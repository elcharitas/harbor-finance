# Harbor Finance ðŸš€

## Introduction

Harbor Finance is a decentralized savings dapp built on `polygon`. It aims to revolutionize the way individuals save money by providing a seamless and automated savings experience. With Harbor Finance, users can effortlessly save funds from their wallet through a secure and transparent process. By leveraging Chainlink's services and functions, Harbor Finance offers features like auto savings, saving goal visualization, and gasless transactions.

## Key Features

### Auto Savings

Harbor Finance simplifies the saving process by enabling users to automatically save funds from their wallet without any manual intervention. Users can sign a contract, and the next day, the specified saving amount will be seamlessly transferred from their wallet to their savings account. This innovative approach eliminates the hassle of remembering to save regularly and ensures consistent progress towards financial goals.

### Saving Goals

Harbor Finance empowers users to define their saving goals, providing them with a clear vision and motivation for their financial objectives. Users can set metadata for each goal, including a name, description, and duration. For example, a user might set a goal to save \$500 for a vacation within 3 months. Harbor Finance enables users to track their progress towards achieving these goals, offering a visual representation of their savings growth over time.

### Gasless Transactions

To enhance user experience and minimize costs, Harbor Finance utilizes Chainlink Functions, a new service by Chainlink. This enables gasless transactions, where users only need to sign a message instead of signing an approval and directly calling the function. By eliminating the need for users to pay gas fees for each transaction, Harbor Finance significantly reduces the financial burden associated with decentralized saving.

### Social Integration:

To foster a sense of community and encourage collaboration, we introduced social features powered by lens protocol. Users are able to share their saving goals, progress, and achievements with friends, creating a supportive environment for financial growth.
